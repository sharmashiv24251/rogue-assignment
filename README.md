# 🚀 Fullstack Developer Intern Assignment: Weather-Based Activity Suggester

Welcome to your Fullstack Developer Internship Assignment! This repository is a **starter template** for building a **Weather-Based Activity Suggester**. Your focus should be primarily on the **frontend**, creating an extraordinary user interface and experience to demonstrate your UI/UX design and problem-solving skills. No backend or DevOps knowledge is required—deploy your app to Vercel for review.

## 📌 Assignment Overview

As a Fullstack Intern (Frontend-focused), your task is to develop a **Weather-Based Activity Suggester** that fetches weather data for a user-specified location using a weather API and suggests creative activities based on the current weather conditions. You’ll design an intuitive, visually stunning interface that delights users and deploy it to Vercel.

## 🎯 Objectives

You are expected to:

- [ ] Design a user-friendly, visually appealing interface for entering a location and displaying weather information
- [ ] Integrate with a weather API to fetch and display current weather data
- [ ] Suggest creative activities based on weather conditions
- [ ] Ensure the application is fully responsive across desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Deploy the application to Vercel and provide the deployed link
- [ ] Write clean, modular code with clear comments
- [ ] Provide clear documentation in a `README.md` file

## 🛠️ Technologies to Use

**Frontend:**

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS or any framework like React, Vue, Angular, etc.—your choice!)
- Optional: Libraries like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or animations (e.g., GSAP) for enhanced design

**API:**

- A free weather API (e.g., [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/))

**Deployment:**

- Vercel
